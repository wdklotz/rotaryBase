<p>A recently formed Rotary club which draws members from the Durance Valley area of Haute Provence and especially welcomes both genders.</p>
<p>Our Rotary Club is bilingual, i.e. French and English. This stems from our multi-cultural aspirations. We have several members 
    of various nationalities and from different walks of life, including a number of members from the nearby International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (<a href="http://www.iter.org/">ITER</a>).</p>
<p>Rotary International consists of 1.2 million members in 34,000 clubs in over 200 countries in the world.It is a voluntary non-profit organization where 
    neighbours, friends, community and professional leaders come together to create positive, lasting change in our communities and all over the world.
    We meet primarily to organize charitable works. We also encourage personal growth, networking and hold social events throughout the year, often with members 
    of nearby clubs, and special guests.</p>
<p>As a new Rotary Club in Provence we invite interested members of the community to join us. If you are a Rotarian visiting the area, you will be 
    welcome at one of our meetings on Tuesday evenings in Gréoux-les-Bains.</p>
