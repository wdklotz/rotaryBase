	*) The difference between editors and authors is that the
		editors can create pages, edit and delete any page, while the authors can
		create pages (with some optional restrictions) and can only edit/delete the
		pages they have created.</p>

	**) In the publishing business, a slug is a short name given
	to an article that is in production.</p>
